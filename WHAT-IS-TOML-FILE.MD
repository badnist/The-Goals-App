### Summary:

The `netlify.toml` file is a configuration file for Netlify that specifies settings for building and deploying a site. It includes build settings like the directory to publish (`dist`) and the command to run (`npm run build`). The redirects section manages URL redirects, ensuring that all routes (`/*`) are redirected to the single-page application entry point (`/index.html`) with a 200 status code. This is crucial for client-side routing in single-page applications, ensuring proper handling of all paths by the front-end application.
